Diabetes is a chronic disease and around 1.5 to 5 million deaths occur every year due
to it. In light of this, four neural network models have been developed to predict the likelihood
of a person of being a diabetic. These models include Logistic Regression, Backward
Propagation, Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree architecture. All the models are
developed and tested in Jupyter notebook. The highest accuracy reported is 77.9%
